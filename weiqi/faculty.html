  <h2>Upcoming Competition</h2>
  <p>I'm not sure if this will end up being a widget or what not, but here I want to 
    display a bracket of the Upcoming competiton, which will be update after each game.
    Winners will be updated and who plays who will be update so that players and 
    spectators can refer back to this site for up to date stats for the current 
    tournament. So, this will be changed alot.

     <p>Weiqi is blah blah write ........also know as baduk comes from blah
      eproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33
      from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in
       their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1
       914 translation by H. Rackham.</p>
</section>

<article>
  <h2>Past Competitions</h2>
  <p>Here I will put "past compeitions" and put them as little previews, but 
    ultimately they will be links because they are just an "aside" even though labeled
    as a article lol, but I will set them up maybe similarlly to how I set up the 
    "new articles and stuff" on the index page
